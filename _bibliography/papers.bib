  abstract  = {Infants understand that people pursue goals, but how do they
               learn which goals people prefer? We tested whether infants solve
               this problem by inverting a mental model of action planning,
               trading off the costs of acting against the rewards actions
               bring. After seeing an agent attain two goals equally often at
               varying costs, infants expected the agent to prefer the goal it
               attained through costlier actions. These expectations held
               across three experiments that conveyed cost through different
               physical path features (height, width, and incline angle),
               suggesting that an abstract variable---such as ``force,''
               ``work,'' or ``effort''---supported infants' inferences. We
               modeled infants' expectations as Bayesian inferences over
               utility-theoretic calculations, providing a bridge to recent
               quantitative accounts of action understanding in older children
               and adults.},

@article{Parkinson2014-ab,
  title    = "A common cortical metric for spatial, temporal, and social
              distance",
  author   = "Parkinson, Carolyn and Liu, Shari and Wheatley, Thalia",
  abstract = "Distance describes more than physical space: we speak of close
              friends and distant relatives, and of the near future and distant
              past. Did these ubiquitous spatial metaphors arise in language
              coincidentally or did they arise because they are rooted in a
              common neural computation? To address this question, we used
              statistical pattern recognition techniques to analyze human fMRI
              data. First, a machine learning algorithm was trained to
              discriminate patterns of fMRI responses based on relative
              egocentric distance within trials from one distance domain (e.g.,
              photographs of objects relatively close to or far away from the
              viewer in spatial distance trials). Next, we tested whether the
              decision boundary generated from this training could distinguish
              brain responses according to relative egocentric distance within
              each of two separate distance domains (e.g., phrases referring to
              the immediate or more remote future within temporal distance
              trials; photographs of participants' friends or acquaintances
              within social distance trials). This procedure was repeated using
              all possible combinations of distance domains for training and
              testing the classifier. In all cases, above-chance decoding
              across distance domains was possible in the right inferior
              parietal lobule (IPL). Furthermore, the representational
              similarity structure within this brain area reflected
              participants' own judgments of spatial distance, temporal
              soon-ness, and social familiarity. Thus, the right IPL may
              contain a parsimonious encoding of proximity to self in spatial,
              temporal, and social frames of reference.",

  title    = "Worth the wait: Children trade off delay and reward in self- and
              other-benefiting decisions",
  author   = "Liu, S and Gonzalez, G and Warneken, F",
  abstract = "Abstract Human prosocial behaviors are supported by
              early-emerging psychological processes that detect and fulfill
              the needs of others. However, little is known about the
              mechanisms that enable children to deliver benefits to others at
              costs to the self, which requires weighing other-regarding and
              self-serving preferences. We used an intertemporal choice
              paradigm to systematically study and compare these behaviors in
              5-year-old children. Our results show that other-benefiting and
              self-benefiting behavior share a common decision-making process
              that integrates delay and reward. Specifically, we found that
              children sought to minimize delay and maximize reward, and traded
              off delays against rewards, regardless of whether these rewards
              were for the children themselves or another child. However, we
              found that children were more willing to invest their time to
              benefit themselves than someone else. Together, these findings
              show that from childhood, other- and self-serving decisions are
              supported by a general mechanism that flexibly integrates
              information about the magnitude of rewards, and the opportunity
              costs of pursuing them. A video abstract of this article can be

@UNPUBLISHED{CTSL-pre,
  title    = "iCatcher+: Robust and automatic gaze classification of infant
              webcam videos",
  author   = "Cao, Peng and Tan, Xincheng and Scott, Kimberly M and Liu, Shari",
  abstract = "Studies of human infants provide a window into the origins of the
              mind, and collecting and annotating behavioral data from them
              remains slow and laborious. Although online platforms enable
              families to participate in studies via webcam, it remains time-
              and energy- consuming to manually annotate gaze directions on the
              collected videos. Existing gaze coding algorithms on videos
              either suffer from low video quality or still require
              considerable manual effort. In this project, we built on a
              promising system for automatic gaze annotation in human infants,
              iCatcher (Erel et al., 2020), and added two key additional
              features: a more robust infant face detector, and a gaze
              estimator that takes into account not only the features of the
              selected face, but where and how far it is from the screen. In
              our framework, iCatcher+, all possible faces in a video frame are
              first extracted by a face extractor, and then the infant face is
              selected by a infant selector; finally, the gaze direction is
              classified by a gaze estimator based on both the selected face
              and features of its bounding box. We evaluated iCatcher+ on a
              large-scale infant video dataset collected via webcam. The
              experimental results show improvements in gaze estimation
              accuracy, compared to the baseline framework. We see iCatcher+ as
              a key tool for enabling rapid large-scale studies of infant
              behavior.",
